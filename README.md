> PR of Testing Repo: https://github.com/Mukul1312/codemate-assignment-testing-repo/pulls

## Updates till now:
 - [ ] /explain commands are detectable from the commit message as well as oldest comment in the PR.
 - [ ] Improved commenting by the bot in PR by adding LLM response error handling and delayed response.
 - [ ] Refactored code of index.js 
    - GitHub API logic in api/github file
    - utils folder for storing utility functions like getCommand.
    - separate file for handling LLM prompt.
 - [ ] Optimized the LLM prompt by implementing these functionalitiy: (It's still in progress thus not merged with updated-version branch and can be found in ["prompt-optimization"]("https://github.com/Mukul1312/codemate-assignment/tree/optimized-prompt")) branch
    - [ ] exclude generated or binary files from the prompt that don't contribute to the code change.
    - [ ] Other optimizations like removing formatting adjustments, truncating code snippets, etc are on the way. ðŸ˜Š

## Setup

### Requirements
- [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys/) : sk-xxx

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm run start
```
- You need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the env file.
- In browser, go to http://localhost:3000/ and create a new GitHub App.

## Summary Report
It was quite an amazing experience to integrate the AI Tools with the GitHub app since I was new to webhooks and Probot, AI.

### Approach:
I started to learn webhooks and then the efficiency of WebHooks over API's. Then, I took a reference from dev.to create a GitHub app. ( By this time I had only 3 hours) Then, I read the quick start section of the documentation of open AI to integrate it into the application.

#### Challenges Faced:
- Find difficulties while prompting code into LLM. But was able to overcome it.
- There are not many articles online for creating the tutorial. It reconfirms that this space is new.
- The LLM Model works for small code change (about 100 lines) but, When I tried /explain on code changes of 500. It's starting breaking. Currently, I've handled it with catch statement. ~~But, I'm looking for a better solution.~~ Am to handle upto 500 lines. (Check latest comment of this [PR]("https://github.com/Mukul1312/codemate-assignment/pull/1"))

### Suggestion:
The article provided as a reference in PFA for creating the first GitHub app requires a paid subscription. So, I've taken a reference from this article. 
https://dev.to/github/developing-my-first-github-app-with-probot-3g0p 

### Future Scope:
- I'm looking to launch this app on the GitHub marketplace and make it available for all the users. Not sure if it's possible with the free subscription of OpenAI and GitHub.

### Vote of Thanks:
- I would like to thank the CodeMate team for providing me with this opportunity. I've really learning a lot from this assignment. I'm looking forward to working with you guys. ðŸ˜Š
