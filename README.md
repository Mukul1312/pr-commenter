## Summary Report
It was quite an amazing experience to integrate the AI Tools with the GitHub app since I was new to webhooks and Probot, AI.

### Current Functionality Implemented:
/explain the command working when put in the description of PR Creation.

### Approach:
I started to learn webhooks and then the efficiency of WebHooks over API's. Then, I took a reference from dev.to create a GitHub app. ( By this time I had only 3 hours) Then, I read the quick start section of the documentation of open AI to integrate it into the application.

#### Challenges:
Find difficulties while prompting code into LLM. But was able to overcome it.
There are not many articles online for creating the tutorial. It reconfirms that this space is new.

### Suggestion:
The article provided as a reference in PFA for creating the first GitHub app requires a paid subscription. So, I've taken a reference from this article.

### Side note
I will still work on this project to implement the PISTON API. Hope that my updated version after the deadline will be considerable.
